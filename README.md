# Rules
Each player is dealt a card, card with the higher value scores a point. If two same-value cards are drawn, players play war - each draws 3 cards, based on the value of the last cards drawn the winner scores 3 points. Game ends when the deck is empty.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Deck of Cards API

## Optimizations:
+ Instead of completely discarding played cards, the winner of each round could put the cards in their discard pile and later reuse them after the main deck is empty. The game would end after one player doesn't have any cards left.

## Lessons Learned:
The goal of this project was to practice utilising external APIs and async functions and their implementation through DOM manipulation.
